# Servlet Filter and Wrapper Example

This project demonstrates the usage of servlet filters and request wrappers in a Java web application. It includes a simple servlet, filter, and wrapper classes to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Servlet**: `MyServlet1.java`
   - A servlet class responsible for handling HTTP requests.
   - It retrieves the value of the parameter "username" from the request and prints it to the response.

2. **Servlet Filter**: `MyFilter1.java`
   - A filter class that intercepts requests before they reach the servlet.
   - It prints a message indicating that the request is being filtered.
   - It creates an instance of `RequestWrapper1` to modify request parameters.
   - It then passes the request to the next filter or servlet in the chain.

3. **Request Wrapper**: `RequestWrapper1.java`
   - A custom wrapper class for the request object.
   - It overrides the `getParameter` method to modify the behavior of retrieving request parameters.
   - If the parameter is empty, it sets a default value indicating that the user should enter their name.

4. **Web Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)**
   - Configures servlet, filter, and their mappings.
   - Defines the welcome file.

5. **Web Page (Webpage1.jsp)**
   - A JSP page containing a form where users can enter their name and city.
   - Upon submission, the form sends a request to the servlet (`MyServ`).
